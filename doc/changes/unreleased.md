# Unreleased

This release comes with breaking changes in package `exasol.analytics.schema`:
* Classes `ColumnType` and `ColumnBuilder` are removed
* Class `Column` is changed significantly
* Subclasses of `Column` have been added for specific column types:
  * `BooleanColumn`
  * `CharColumn`
  * `DateColumn`
  * `DecimalColumn`
  * `DoublePrecisionColumn`
  * `GeometryColumn`
  * `HashTypeColumn`
  * `TimeStampColumn`
  * `VarCharColumn`
* Additional classes have been added for specific attributes of some of the column types:
  * `CharSet`
  * `HashSizeUnit`
* Convenience functions for creating instances of `Column` have been replaced by class method `simple()` of the resp. subclasses of `Column`:
  * `decimal_column()`
  * `varchar_column()`
  * `hashtype_column()`


Please see the [User Guide](http://github.com/exasol/advanced-analytics-framework/blob/main/doc/user_guide/database_objects.md) about creating and using instances of `Column` starting with this release.
